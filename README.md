- Avoid close window: hide to tray
- System tray menu
- Toggle window visibility with right click on system tray

## Roadmap

- Work around the "Go to Slack.com" link on startup
- In app preferences
- Configurable behaviour for close button (close, minimize, hide)
- Configurable keyboard shortuts
- Gnome and Plank context menu options
